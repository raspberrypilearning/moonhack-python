## Displaying a List

In this step we are going to display all of the items the user has on this mission.

  
To display the items in the list made on lines 3-13 we are going to create what is called a `for-loop`.

+ On line 21 of your program (before the final line of code) type the following loop:

+ Run your code. You should see all the items in the list print to the screen. If you do not see this happening, check your code for any errors. Please note that Python is very particular! All the symbols and spaces must be just as you see in the code above.


+ Python uses __indentation__ (moving the code to the right) to show which code is inside the `for loop`. You can either use two spaces (tap the spacebar twice) or tap the __tab key__ (usually above CAPSLOCK on the keyboard.)
