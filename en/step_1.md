## Introduction

Imagine a future when trips back and forth to the moon become as common as flying on an airplane.  Some scientists believe we are not far from a time when this might be true. What would some of the dangers of this be? Would it be safe for someone to travel to the moon alone?

In this activity we are going to simulate a dangerous situation of someone who is stranded on the moon.
