## Interacting with the User

In this step we are going to ask the user to type in the four items they would like to bring.



+ To allow the user to type in their content we are going to use an input statement. This statement will go below all the code we have in our program right now.

+ Next, we are going to need to store the information the user types into a variable called `user_choice` so we can use it later. This code will go on the same line as what we just typed in.

+ Next, we are going to make sure our code is working the way it should. We are going to ask our program to print what the user typed in.

+ Run your code. Type your selection after it says "Enter your choice:" and hit enter. Do you see your selection appear? If not, check your code for any errors before moving on.

+ Next, we are going to hide the code we just typed because in our final program we do not want the user_choice variable to appear in the program. To hide this code from you program we are going to turn it into a “comment” by placing a hashtag (#) before it.
