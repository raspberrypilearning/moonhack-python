## Organizing the User Input 

In this step we are going to organize what the user has typed into a list so we can evaluate it later.



+ To organize what the user has typed in we are going to store their list into a variable called `user_list`.

+ Take a look at what is happening in the line of code we just wrote. It is asking the program to create a “list” of things. It is then asking the “list” to split each item by a comma. Do you now see why it is so important for the user to type a comma after each letter?

+ Next, we are going to make sure our code is working the way it should. We are going to ask our program to print what the user typed in. Type the following code:

+ Run your code. Type your selection and hit enter. Do you see a “list” of what you have typed in with commas? If not, check your code for any errors before moving on.

+ Next, we are going to hide the code we just typed just like we did in in step 3. To hide this code from you program we are going to turn it into a “comment” by placing a hashtag (#) before it.
