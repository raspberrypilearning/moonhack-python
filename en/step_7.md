## Evaluating the User Input 

If the user does not pick the correct items needed to get to the moon base you will need to write code that tells them what item they were suppose to pick.



+ There is only one correct group of items that will get the user to the moon base safely, `A,E,F,I`. If the user forgets to put Item A on their list then the code below will tell them why that item is needed.

+ Next, we are going to repeat the same process for the other three items the user must select.

+ Test your code! Run the program several times. If you select `A,E,F,I` then nothing should appear. If you forget an item, then you should receive a message telling exactly which item you must bring.
